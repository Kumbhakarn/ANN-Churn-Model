# Churn Prediction with ANN using Streamlit Web App

This project demonstrates the implementation of a churn prediction model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and deploys it as an interactive Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.

## Overview
The churn prediction model is built using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict whether a customer will churn based on historical data. The model is integrated with a Streamlit web application to provide a user-friendly interface for making real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras (for ANN)
- Streamlit (for web app)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Scikit-Learn (for preprocessing and model evaluation)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.6+)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-prediction-ann-streamlit.git
    cd churn-prediction-ann-streamlit
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Streamlit App
To run the churn prediction Streamlit app, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local server and open the Streamlit web app in your default browser.

### Model Training (if needed)
If you need to train the model yourself, run the `train_model.py` script to train the ANN model on your dataset. The trained model will be saved as `churn_model.h5`.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

Once trained, the model will be ready for use in the Streamlit app.

## Model Explanation
The churn prediction model is built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is trained to predict whether a customer will churn based on various features, such as customer demographics, account details, and usage patterns. The ANN consists of input layers, hidden layers, and an output layer. We use the Keras library to implement the ANN and the TensorFlow framework for training.
